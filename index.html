<h1>Fish Adventure!</h1>
<p>There is a beautiful lake where all the lake animals live in peace. In this story, you are a fish.
    One day, your best friend swims up to you. She is panicked. She explains that she heard 2 fishermen talking to each other, saying that they are going to come to our lake and catch fish for dinner tommorow. She says that she is going to swim to a nearby pond. However, you must remember that the journey to the pond is long and dangerous. Do you go with your best friend or do you stay in the lake? </p>
