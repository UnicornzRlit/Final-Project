<h1>Stay In The Lake</h1>
<p>You stayed in the lake! You watch as your best friend swims away. You feel sad. You and your best friend were inseperable. Now you are not together anymore. You realize it's getting dark. You go to your home and sleep. The next day, The fishermen arrive. Do you stay in your home or go to the middle of the lake?</p>
